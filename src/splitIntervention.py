Designing these functions first for the folktables prediction task(s), so we can test
and make decisions. We would like these to be more generalizable to other prediction tasks and
data in the future though. This may be done by requiring (building?) pre-processing steps of input data
(like ISTAT), in fact, perhaps the folktables formate can serve as the template for the required
pre-processing...
 
-------
ACSPublicCoverage Task: Predict whether a low-income individual, not eligible for Medicare, has coverage from public health
insurance.

My interest in this one is that the task is one of finding uncovered people, thus already more interesting from a social value perspective
than a lot of toy examples, so maybe it can take us somewhere interesting.

the thing with this one is that none of the features 'should' lead to lack of coverage, however all of them
are valid for prediction, since you want to find out if there is discrimination, and use knowledge of it 
to identify uncovered people...in this case it seems like all features are of interest...but I will start with
the protected attributes for now...


Demographic Features of Interest:
SEX (Male / Female)
RAC1P (Recoded detailed race code, 9 possible values)
SCHL (educational attainment) - since there is no income...

-------
ACSIncome Task: Predict  whether US working adultsâ€™ yearly income is above $50,000 (threshold can be adjusted)

This might be a bit more straight forward.

Demographic Features of Interest:
SEX (Male / Female)
RAC1P (Recoded detailed race code, 9 possible values)

#   For example, branch split on gender, then income, now we need gender proportion
