[Domain Adaptive Decision Trees: Implications for Accuracy and Fairness](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3593013.3594008). *FAccT '23: Proceedings of the 2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency*, June 2023, Pages 423â€“433, DOI: 10.1145/3593013.3594008.

The data used is under the data folder, though it can be downloaded using FolkTables. 

The scripts are under the source folder. It is necessary to run the notebook 01_CalculateDistances first. The notebook 02_PlotDistances analysis these results. The notebook 03_TestSingleSourceTarget presents an example on how to implement DADT. The notebook 04_AnalyseResults carries out the analysis presented in the paper and should be run after running script experiments.py. 

The results are stored under the results folder.
